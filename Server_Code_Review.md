On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 3 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code: The program all compiles, but when you are trying to run it Blue.java could not open the port and would exit which wouldnt work with the server. For the Chat server you could have merged all the while loops into 1 loop and using booleans to exit at certain times.
